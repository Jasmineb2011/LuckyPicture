* our Project aim is to let the client choose a picture by submitting a number (0-1084) in the submit button
* then our App will take that number and choose the picture with that id
* set the background of the page to that same picture
* The app will show options for the client if he wants the picture to be on a gray scale or blue = by the buttons "blurred" & "grayScale";
* the download button send the client to a link to download the picture = using href target="-blank" (and the fetsh to the API of the list images from the site).
