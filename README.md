* our Project aim is to let the client choose a picture by submitting a number (0-1084) in the submit button :crystal_ball:
* then our App will take that number and choose the picture with that id from the unsplash.com API :floppy_disk:
* set the background of the page to that same picture :fireworks:
* The page has 3 options buttons for the picture:  
 1. Grayscaled - by adding `/g/` to the url.
 2. Bluered  - by adding `&blur` to the url.
 3. the download button that send the client to the page to download the picture - using `window.open(url, _blank);`
 and here we used fetch to get the API of "unsplash.com" to choose the picture with the id that the clients inserts in the input

 it was very challenging to make the app
 and if we had more time we would work on more sites at once

 HOPE YOU LIKE IT ! :heart:
