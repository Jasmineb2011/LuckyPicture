* our Project aim is to let the client choose a picture by submitting a number (0-1084) in the submit button
* then our App will take that number and choose the picture with that id
* set the background of the page to that same picture
* show the client a link to download the picture too : using href target="-blank"
* also make opthions for the client if he wants the picture to be on a gray scale
* or blurred
