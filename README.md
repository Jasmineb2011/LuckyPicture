 Making it happen step by stap :

* our Page aim is to let the client choose a picture by submitting a number (0-1084) in the submit button :crystal_ball:
* then our page will take that number and choose the picture with that id from the unsplash.com `API` :floppy_disk:
* set the background of the page to that same picture :fireworks:
* The page has 3 options buttons for the picture:  
 1. Grayscaled - by adding `/g/` to the url.
 2. Bluered  - by adding `&blur` to the url.
 3. the download button that send the client to the page to download the picture - using `window.open(url, _blank);` (which was new for us - after we had many attempts to use different kind of tags type and `href` methods for the tags)
 and here we used `fetch` to get the `API` of "unsplash.com" to choose the picture with the id that the clients inserts in the input.

 It was very challenging to make the page
 and if we had more time we would work on more sites at once.

 HOPE YOU LIKE IT ! :heart:
